Dowse was first conceptualized under the name of Ghettobox and
refined in on-line and on-site exchanges within the Italian
hackmeeting community.

Its (fairly minimal) codebase is designed, written and maintained by
Denis Roio <jaromil@dyne.org> and distributed by the Dyne.org foundation.
Anatole Shaw and Patrick Mc.Donald have contributed with ideas and testing.

Dowse depends from various free and open source software components
redistributed under the GNU GPLv2 and GPLv3, MIT/BSD or Apache
licenses. Their sources are the property of the respective authors and
are used by Dowse in the binary form offered by major distributions.
