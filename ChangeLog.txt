0.4 Network model refactoring and module system
	The need for a bridge interface was removed: now
	Dowse works just on a single physical interface.
	Ebtables is adopted for layer 2 mac address filtering
	against arp spoofing. A module system is in place now
	to activate / deactivate features. The first module
	supports dnscrypt-proxy to protect all DNS traffic.
	
0.3 Tor integration and proxy performance fixes
	Testing, code refactoring and stability fixes
	Squid has been tuned to use reasonable amounts of RAM
	Tor is now configured and started

	Several checks for smooth deployement on Debian 7
	Renamed to "dowse" - local area network rabdomancy

0.1 Initial release
	Versioning the set of scripts used to build and administer my home network
	Working name: ghettobox (from an old thread on the hackmeeting mailinglist)
