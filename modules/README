This directory contains modules for Dowse

Look into 'available' to see all modules.

Make a symlink of any of them into 'enabled' to activate it.

At start, Dowse will activate all modules present in 'enabled'.

Modules are very simple to make, all what Dowse does is execute the
$module/conf.zsh file with zsh. That script will create and add
configurations accordingly.
