This directory contains modules for Dowse

Look into 'available' to see all modules.

Make a symlink of any of them into 'enabled' to activate it.

At start, Dowse will activate all modules present in 'enabled'.

Modules are very simple to make and consist in 3 functions:
module_stetup() creates all needed configurations
module_start() launches the daemon (possibly saving its pid)
module_stop() kills the daemon (possibly using the pid)

For a good simple start have a look at the dnscrypt-proxy module.
