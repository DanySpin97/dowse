Dowse was first conceptualized under the name of Ghettobox and
refined in on-line and on-site exchanges within the Italian
hackmeeting community.

Its (fairly minimal) codebase is designed, written and maintained by
Denis Roio <jaromil@dyne.org> and distributed by the Dyne.org foundation.

Parazyd, Federico Bonelli, Rob van Kranenburg, Roger Dep, Anatole
Shaw, Hellekin O. Wolf and Patrick Mc.Donald have contributed with
ideas and testing.

Dowse development is supported by: NLNET foundation (2015)
                                   SIDNfonds   (2015-2016)

Dowse depends from various free and open source software components
